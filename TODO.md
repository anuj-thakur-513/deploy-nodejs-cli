- Add deployment for Frontend Projects
    - steps:
        - install NGINX
        - build project
        - copy to /var/www/frontend (or any directory name)
        - Disable NGINX default configuration
        - write NGINX config file in /etc/nginx/conf.d directory for frontend

- Add deployment for Docker Projects (yet to decide the steps)
